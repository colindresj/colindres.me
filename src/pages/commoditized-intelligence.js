      <h2>Commoditized Intelligence</h2>

      <p>
      Machine learning and AI (as it’s commonly spoken about, not in the sense
      of artificial general intelligence) will become a commodity. There are
      thousands of open-source libraries that allow development teams to tap into
      neural networks, deep learning, image recognition, etc. Furthermore, there
      are services, like AWS Rekognition and Google’s AI Platform, that mean you
      can get started with machine learning even without a team of data
      scientists and ML engineers (I’m admittedly taking some leniency with that
      last statement).
      </p>

      <p>
      As compute gets better and data sets continue to balloon, software will
      get smarter and a host of businesses will employ ML and AI to deliver a
      better experience for customers. There will come a time, in fact, when
      nearly every new business will use basic intelligence in some capacity or
      another. The best of these companies will do just fine.
      </p>

      <p>
      The irony, however, is that most of the value generated by AI and ML will
      not be created by these companies, but instead by the holders of data. In
      other words, it’ll become increasingly easier to create smart features,
      leading to a democratization and also commoditization of AI and ML. The
      unique value, then will only emerge via the businesses that are able to
      control data.
      </p>

      <p>
      Just as there will be companies employing machine learning and AI to
      create better experiences, there will also be (and already are, in fact)
      startups that offer intelligent services. In the long run, these companies
      will struggle. Put simply, this has to do with the idea that ML models
      perform better when they are given a larger data set of past history to go
      off of. The biggest tech companies in the world have such data sets and are
      continually taking steps to increase their grasp of data.
      </p>

      <p>
      Opportunities, however, still exist. First, if a company can establish
      partnerships with the big tech players in order to provide services that
      the large company is either not interested in or cannot provide, the
      startup can gain access to a treasure trove of data that will set it apart
      from the competition. Companies like Sprinklr and Datasift have shown this
      is a viable route.
      </p>

      <p>
      Another way is to eschew the tech companies all together in favor of
      working with traditional incumbents. IBM’s Watson business, for example,
      has partnered with enough big, legacy companies and aggregated their data
      together to build differentiated and defensible products. The advertising
      space holds a number of examples of companies that have managed to succeed
      by following this strategy as well.
      </p>

      <p>
      The most interesting possibility, however, is for a startup to generate
      its own unique data set and grow it fast enough to gain an advantage over
      incumbents. This, of course, plays into the perpetual battle of sustainment
      versus disruption as laid out in the Innovator’s Dilemma and is easier said
      than done, although Lemonade appears to have made some serious traction by
      following this approach. Nevertheless, the difficulty of this path means
      most successful AI and ML startups will have to rely on partnerships. There
      will be those special few, however, that manage to be exceptional.
