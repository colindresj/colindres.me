      <h2>Data Explained</h2>

      <p>
      In organizations of nearly all levels, there’s now a firm reliance on
      data. Business professionals, strategists, engineers, and scientists all
      use data to get their work done. With the heavier reliance on data there’s
      a risk of data-inundation. That is, when there is too much data for an
      individual or team to make sense of. To manage this risk, a new set of
      startups will rise to service the need to explain the data.
      </p>

      <p>
      As physical work is replaced by automation and digitization – all of it
      backed by data – more of the work done in offices will shift towards the
      complex comprehension of data feeds and settling on decisions. That is what
      I mean by explaining data. To facilitate this shift in work, new tools will
      need to be created.
      </p>

      <p>
      Both Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics, for example, have built-in
      anomaly detection. Tableau takes this explaining approach one step further
      and allows users to easily get data-driven responses to questions like “why
      are bike rentals spiking in August?”
      </p>

      <p>
      In time, more businesses will be built around leveraging the millions of
      observational data points to provide more explanations on everything from
      automated machine lines in a manufacturing facility to page views and click
      rates. I believe the opportunity exists in developing a unique form of data
      capture to facilitate the explanation of data in areas that are currently
      not being looked at by incumbents.
